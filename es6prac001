So what is happening here?

Let initializes a variable, in this case an object on the first line
in the for each function I am passing in first and last inside curly braces, and logging it
the next line it doesnt matter if i use john jane or gadorpadorp its assigning names for the objects based on position.
for a on object with nested objects, this means that [firstObj, secondObj, ... lastObj]
line 12 creates a function lastName that passes in the 'last' propert of the specified object.
having specified the objects with variables on line 11, I can now pass in the individual objects, and pass out the 'last' property
